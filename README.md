*DOMAIN*: FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

📌DESCRITION:

As part of Task 2 for the CodTech Full Stack Development Internship, I built a real-time collaborative document editor. This editor allows multiple users to type simultaneously and view each other's input live, using WebSockets via Socket.IO.This tool replicates basic real-time text sync functionality like Google Docs, where edits made in one browser reflect instantly in another without refreshing.

🛠️ Technologies Used

React.js – frontend UI for the text editor

Node.js – backend runtime environment

Socket.IO – enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server

Express.js – for basic server setup and WebSocket integration

🔗 Data Platform / Real-Time Engine

Communication Protocol: WebSockets

Library Used: Socket.IO

Data Exchanged: Text editor content in real time
